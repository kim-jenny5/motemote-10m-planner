# Digital 10-Minute Planner (Motemote Clone)

A digital clone of the viral _10-Minute Planner_ by 모트모트 (Motemote), built as a personal project to explore modern frontend tools.

---

## Overview

This app aims to replicate the structure and accountability of the original Motemote planner in a digital format. Users will be able to:

- Sign up / log in (OAuth via Supabase)
- Create and manage 100-day planners
- Use a built-in timer to log focused work sessions

Currently, only the homepage is live. I’m actively working on auth integration and user flows.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js** – file-based routing and full-stack capabilities
- **React** – UI library
- **TypeScript** – safer, predictable code
- **Supabase** – auth and PostgreSQL-backed data storage
- **Tailwind CSS** – utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion** – smooth UI animations

---

### Why This Stack?

- **Next.js** - it's the “it” frontend framework right now — powerful, fast, and widely adopted.
- **Supabase** - quick to scaffold OAuth, backed by PostgreSQL
- **TypeScript** - to catch errors early, write safer code, and learn what's becoming the default in many teams across the industry
- **Tailwind CSS** - lets me style quickly with a system I’m already comfortable with.

## Tools Used

- **Vercel v0** – UI prototyping
- **ChatGPT** – idea scaffolding, debugging help
- **Figma** – logo and design drafts ([see designs]('https://www.figma.com/design/5ZEAJm8uQ3b1ou2XizvGL9/Untitled?m=auto&t=FFeY1ZWhvpHDuFJi-1'))

---

## Current Progress

- Homepage is scaffolded
- OAuth setup with Supabase is in progress
- Signup/Login pages are underway

---

## What's Next

- Complete auth flow
- Implement a frontend testing framework
- Design user dashboard
- Build planner creation and tracking tools
- Integrate and test timer logging
